## 🎯 Core Business Rules

### 1. **Approval Workflow Rules**

#### Rule 1.1: User Role-Based Approval
- **REQUESTER** tickets → **MUST** require manager approval
- **TECHNICIAN** tickets → **NO** approval required (direct to assigned)
- **ADMIN** tickets → **NO** approval required (direct to assigned)
- **MANAGER** tickets → **NO** approval required (direct to assigned)

#### Rule 1.2: Manager Approval Authority
- **Managers can approve ALL tickets within their branch/unit**
- **Cross-branch approval is permitted** for managers
- **Any available manager** in the branch can approve (no single point of failure)
- **Approval delegation** is automatic within organizational units

#### Rule 1.3: Approval Scope
```
Manager Authority Levels:
├── Branch Manager → Can approve all tickets in branch
├── Unit Manager → Can approve tickets in unit + sub-units  
├── Department Manager → Can approve department-wide tickets
└── Division Manager → Can approve division-wide tickets
```

### 2. **Ticket Routing Rules**

#### Rule 2.1: Domain-Based Routing
```
Business Domain → Target Department:
├── Business/Financial → Dukungan dan Layanan Department
├── Administrative → Dukungan dan Layanan Department  
├── Government/Regulatory → Dukungan dan Layanan Department
├── Technical/IT → Information Technology Department (DEFAULT)
└── Infrastructure → Information Technology Department
```

#### Rule 2.2: Automatic Routing Logic
```typescript
// Routing decision matrix
const routingRules = {
  // Business tickets → Dukungan dan Layanan
  business: {
    keywords: ['kasda', 'keuangan', 'anggaran', 'pembayaran', 'invoice', 'billing'],
    department: 'Dukungan dan Layanan',
    priority: 'high'
  },
  
  // Administrative tickets → Dukungan dan Layanan  
  administrative: {
    keywords: ['surat', 'dokumen', 'administrasi', 'perizinan', 'approval'],
    department: 'Dukungan dan Layanan',
    priority: 'medium'
  },
  
  // Technical tickets → IT (DEFAULT)
  technical: {
    keywords: ['jaringan', 'komputer', 'software', 'hardware', 'sistem'],
    department: 'Information Technology',
    priority: 'medium'
  },
  
  // Default fallback → IT
  default: {
    department: 'Information Technology',
    priority: 'low'
  }
};
```

#### Rule 2.3: Service Catalog Routing
- **Service items** have predefined department assignments
- **KASDA-related services** → Always route to Dukungan dan Layanan
- **Technical services** → Always route to IT
- **Mixed services** → Route based on primary domain

### 3. **Performance & UI Rules**

#### Rule 3.1: Lightweight Interface
- **No unnecessary animations** or transitions
- **Minimal JavaScript bundle** size (< 500KB gzipped)
- **Clean, professional design** with focus on functionality
- **Mobile-responsive** without feature compromise

#### Rule 3.2: Fast Performance
- **Page loads** < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **API responses** < 200ms for 95% of requests  
- **Real-time updates** without page refresh
- **Optimistic UI updates** for better perceived performance

#### Rule 3.3: Zero-Clutter Design
- **Essential information only** on each screen
- **Progressive disclosure** for advanced features
- **Contextual actions** based on user role and ticket state
- **Clear visual hierarchy** with proper spacing

## 🎫 Ticket Lifecycle

### Simplified Status Flow
```
[DRAFT] → [PENDING_APPROVAL] → [APPROVED] → [ASSIGNED] → [IN_PROGRESS] → [RESOLVED] → [CLOSED]
    ↓            ↓                 ↓           ↓            ↓             ↓
[CANCELLED]  [REJECTED]      [CANCELLED]  [OPEN]    [PENDING_USER]  [REOPENED]
```

### Status Definitions
- **DRAFT**: Being created by user (auto-save)
- **PENDING_APPROVAL**: Submitted, waiting for manager approval
- **REJECTED**: Manager rejected, needs revision
- **APPROVED**: Manager approved, ready for assignment
- **ASSIGNED**: Assigned to specific technician
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Technician actively working
- **PENDING_USER**: Waiting for user input/feedback
- **RESOLVED**: Issue fixed, pending user confirmation
- **CLOSED**: Completed and confirmed
- **CANCELLED**: Cancelled by manager or admin
- **REOPENED**: Closed ticket reopened due to issue recurrence

### Auto-Transitions
```typescript
// Automatic status transitions
const autoTransitions = {
  // When requester creates ticket
  'draft → pending_approval': {
    condition: 'user.role === "requester"',
    trigger: 'ticket.submit()'
  },
  
  // When technician creates ticket  
  'draft → approved': {
    condition: 'user.role in ["technician", "admin", "manager"]',
    trigger: 'ticket.submit()'
  },
  
  // Auto-assignment after approval
  'approved → assigned': {
    condition: 'availableTechnician && autoAssignEnabled',
    trigger: 'approval.complete()'
  },
  
  // SLA breach notifications
  'assigned → overdue': {
    condition: 'currentTime > sla.dueDate',
    trigger: 'time.check()'
  }
};
```
