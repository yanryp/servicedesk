# Ticketing System Implementation Guide

## Quick Start Checklist

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Set up development environment (Docker, Node.js, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Initialize project structure with TypeScript
- [ ] Design and implement database schema
- [ ] Set up authentication system with JWT
- [ ] Create basic user management

### Phase 2: Core Ticketing (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement ticket CRUD operations
- [ ] Build ticket listing with filters
- [ ] Add status workflow management
- [ ] Create ticket assignment logic
- [ ] Implement basic email notifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-8)
- [ ] Develop SLA management system
- [ ] Build escalation engine
- [ ] Create reporting dashboard
- [ ] Implement approval workflows
- [ ] Add knowledge base functionality

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (Week 9-12)
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Migrate data from ManageEngine

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Microservices** for scalability
- **Event-driven** for real-time updates
- **API-first** design for flexibility
- **Progressive Web App** for mobile support

### Technology Choices
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React** for modern UI
- **PostgreSQL** for relational data
- **Redis** for caching and sessions
- **Docker** for containerization

### Best Practices
- Write tests as you develop
- Document APIs thoroughly
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow security best practices from day one

## Development Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Build MVP first, then iterate
2. **User Feedback**: Get feedback early and often
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize continuously
4. **Security**: Regular security audits
5. **Documentation**: Keep it updated as you build

## Migration Strategy

1. **Analyze** current ManageEngine data structure
2. **Map** fields to new schema
3. **Test** migration with sample data
4. **Run** parallel systems during transition
5. **Validate** all data post-migration
