# Unit-Based Approval System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a flexible unit-based approval system that eliminates the need for manual manager ID changes when branch managers are on leave or unavailable.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: When a branch manager went on leave, helpdesk admins had to manually change the `managerId` for all users in that branch one by one.

**After**: Any manager in the same unit (branch/capem/department) can approve tickets from that unit automatically.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### New Unit Model
```prisma
model Unit {
  id                  Int                   @id @default(autoincrement())
  code                String                @unique @db.VarChar(50)
  name                String                @db.VarChar(255)
  displayName         String?               @map("display_name") @db.VarChar(255)
  unitType            String                @default("branch") @map("unit_type") @db.VarChar(50) // branch, capem, department
  parentId            Int?                  @map("parent_id")
  departmentId        Int?                  @map("department_id")
  isActive            Boolean               @default(true) @map("is_active")
  sortOrder           Int                   @default(0) @map("sort_order")
  metadata            Json?                 // Store additional branch-specific data
  createdAt           DateTime              @default(now()) @map("created_at") @db.Timestamptz(6)
  updatedAt           DateTime              @default(now()) @updatedAt @map("updated_at") @db.Timestamptz(6)
  
  // Relations
  department          Department?           @relation(fields: [departmentId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  parent              Unit?                 @relation("UnitHierarchy", fields: [parentId], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  children            Unit[]                @relation("UnitHierarchy")
  users               User[]
  
  @@index([unitType, isActive])
  @@index([parentId])
  @@index([departmentId])
  @@map("units")
}
```

#### Updated User Model
- Added `unitId` field to link users to their organizational unit
- Maintains existing `managerId` for backward compatibility

### 2. Smart Approval Logic

#### Three-Tier Fallback System
1. **Primary**: Find managers in the same unit with `isBusinessReviewer: true`
2. **Secondary**: Fall back to department managers if no unit managers available
3. **Tertiary**: Use any available business reviewer as final fallback

#### Implementation Location
`backend/src/routes/enhancedTicketRoutes.ts` - `createBusinessApproval()` method

```typescript
// Find managers from the same unit who can approve
if (ticketCreator.unitId) {
  availableManagers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    where: {
      unitId: ticketCreator.unitId,
      role: { in: ['manager', 'admin'] },
      isAvailable: true,
      isBusinessReviewer: true
    },
    orderBy: [
      { role: 'desc' }, // Prefer admins over managers
      { id: 'asc' }     // Consistent ordering
    ]
  });
}
```

### 3. API Endpoints

#### New Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/v2/tickets/units` - Get all active units
- `GET /api/v2/tickets/unit/:unitId/approvers` - Get available approvers for a specific unit

### 4. Data Migration

#### Migration Script: `scripts/migrate-unit-data.ts`
- Creates units from existing BSGMasterData entries
- Assigns users to appropriate units based on departments
- Creates unit managers with business reviewer permissions
- Establishes proper hierarchical relationships

#### Migration Results
```
üìä Migration Summary:
‚úÖ Total units created: 6
‚úÖ Users assigned to units: 11
‚úÖ Business reviewer managers: 6
```

### 5. Frontend Type Updates

#### Enhanced Type Definitions
```typescript
export interface Unit {
  id: number;
  code: string;
  name: string;
  displayName?: string;
  unitType: string; // branch, capem, department
  parentId?: number;
  departmentId?: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  sortOrder: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  department?: Department;
  parent?: Unit;
  children?: Unit[];
  users?: User[];
}
```

#### Updated User Interfaces
- Added `unitId` and `unit` fields to User and AuthUser interfaces

## Testing Results

### Test Coverage
‚úÖ **Unit Assignment**: All users properly assigned to units  
‚úÖ **Manager Availability**: Each unit has available managers for approval  
‚úÖ **Approval Logic**: Correct manager selection based on unit hierarchy  
‚úÖ **Fallback System**: Handles unavailable managers gracefully  
‚úÖ **Manager Leave Scenario**: System continues working when managers are unavailable

### Sample Manager Accounts Created
```
dept_1.manager@company.com (password: manager123) - IT Department
dept_2.manager@company.com (password: manager123) - Support Department  
cabang_utama.manager@company.com (password: manager123) - Main Branch
capem_jakarta.manager@company.com (password: manager123) - Jakarta Capem
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Operational Efficiency
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: No need to change manager IDs when managers go on leave
- **Automatic Failover**: System finds available managers automatically
- **Reduced Admin Burden**: Helpdesk admins freed from manual user management

### 2. System Reliability
- **Multiple Fallback Levels**: Ensures approvals always have a path
- **Hierarchical Support**: Supports complex organizational structures
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy to add new units and managers

### 3. Business Continuity
- **No Approval Delays**: Tickets continue to flow even when specific managers are unavailable
- **Cross-Coverage**: Multiple managers can approve from the same unit
- **Scalable**: Works for branches, capems, and departments

## Workflow Comparison

### Before Implementation
```
User creates ticket ‚Üí System looks for user.managerId ‚Üí 
If manager on leave ‚Üí ‚ùå No approval possible ‚Üí 
Admin must manually change managerId for all users
```

### After Implementation
```
User creates ticket ‚Üí System finds user.unitId ‚Üí 
Looks for ANY manager in unit ‚Üí If unit manager unavailable ‚Üí 
Falls back to department managers ‚Üí If still none ‚Üí 
Uses any business reviewer ‚Üí ‚úÖ Always finds approver
```
