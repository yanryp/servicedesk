  - Vulnerability Assessment Alert
  - Compliance Violation Alert
  - Security Tool Failure

### 2. SOC-Specific Field System
- **15 Security Fields** per alert template:
  - Alert Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational)

Authorization: Bearer <user-jwt-token>
```

#### Threat Intelligence
```
GET /api/soc-alerts/threat-intelligence?days=7
Authorization: Bearer <user-jwt-token>
```

### 4. SLA Policies for Security Incidents
- **Critical Security Incident**: 15min response, 4h resolution
- **High Security Incident**: 30min response, 8h resolution  
- **Medium Security Incident**: 1h response, 24h resolution
- **Low Security Incident**: 4h response, 72h resolution

### 5. SOC Team User Roles
- **SOC Level 1 Analyst** (`soc.analyst.l1`)
- **SOC Level 2 Analyst** (`soc.analyst.l2`)
- **SOC Level 3 Senior Analyst** (`soc.analyst.l3`)
- **SOC Manager** (`soc.manager`)
- **Chief Information Security Officer** (`ciso`)

All accounts created with default password: `password123`

### 6. Security Workflow Integration
- **Department**: Security & Compliance (ID: 8)
- **Auto-Assignment**: SOC L1 Analyst for automated alerts
- **Escalation Matrix**: Multi-level escalation based on severity
- **Approval Workflow**: High-value incidents require manager approval
- **KASDA Integration**: Banking incidents trigger regulatory notification workflow

curl -X POST "https://bsg-soc.com/api/soc-alerts/ingest" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-webhook-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "alertType": "Network Intrusion Detection",
    "severity": "critical",
    "title": "APT Activity Detected",
    "description": "Lateral movement across domain controllers",
    "sourceSystem": "Splunk Enterprise",
    "detectionTimestamp": "2025-07-10T15:30:00Z",
    "affectedSystems": ["DC01", "DC02"],
    "threatIndicators": ["192.168.1.100", "malicious.com"],
    "requiresRegulatoryNotification": true
  }'
```

### Microsoft Sentinel Logic App
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "uri": "https://bsg-soc.com/api/soc-alerts/ingest",
