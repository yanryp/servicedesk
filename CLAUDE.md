# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Enterprise Ticketing System (ETS) designed to replace ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Free Edition. The system removes the 5-technician limit and provides advanced ticketing features, approval workflows, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Development Commands

Once the project is implemented, the following commands will be available:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                 # Start development servers
npm run dev:backend        # Start backend only  
npm run dev:frontend       # Start frontend only

# Database
npm run db:migrate         # Run Prisma migrations
npm run db:seed           # Seed database with initial data
npm run db:reset          # Reset database completely
npm run db:studio         # Open Prisma Studio

# Testing
npm test                  # Run all tests
npm run test:unit        # Run unit tests only
npm run test:e2e         # Run E2E tests with Cypress
npm run test:coverage    # Generate test coverage report

# Building & Deployment

docker-compose down      # Stop all services
```

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a **microservices architecture** with the following key components:

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Fastify and TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities
- **Queue**: RabbitMQ/Redis Queue for background jobs
- **Authentication**: JWT with access and refresh tokens
- **Real-time**: WebSocket (Socket.io) for notifications
- **Container**: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration

### Core System Components

1. **User Management**: Unlimited technician accounts with RBAC (Admin, Manager, Technician, Requester)
2. **Ticket Approval Workflow**: Requesters submit tickets → Manager approval → Active ticket assignment
3. **Ticket Engine**: Full CRUD with workflow states (Pending Approval → New → Assigned → In Progress → Pending → Resolved → Closed)
4. **SLA Management**: Business hours calculation, breach detection (SLA starts after manager approval)
5. **Escalation Engine**: Multi-level, time-based escalations after ticket approval
6. **Notification System**: Real-time WebSocket + email notifications for approvals and updates
7. **Knowledge Base**: Article management with versioning and approval workflows
8. **Reporting Dashboard**: Real-time analytics with Chart.js/Recharts
9. **API Gateway**: RESTful API with comprehensive documentation and webhooks

### Ticket Approval Workflow

**Critical Implementation Detail**: The escalation system works as follows:

1. **Requester submits ticket** → Status: "Pending Approval"
2. **Manager receives approval notification** → Manager can Approve/Reject/Request More Info
3. **Upon approval** → Status changes to "New" and SLA timer starts
4. **Ticket assignment** → Status changes to "Assigned" 
5. **Normal workflow continues** → In Progress → Pending → Resolved → Closed

**Key Points**:
- SLA calculations only begin AFTER manager approval
- Approval notifications are high priority (email + in-app)
- Managers can delegate approval authority
- Approval history is fully audited
- Rejected tickets can be revised and resubmitted

### Database Schema Structure

The system uses both a hierarchical service catalog structure and a comprehensive branch network:

**Service Catalog Hierarchy**:
- **Services** → **Categories** → **Subcategories**
- Each level can have different approval rules and SLA policies
- Dynamic form fields based on category selection

**Branch Network Structure** (BSG Banking System):
- **CABANG (Main Branches)**: 27 primary branch offices with full banking services
- **CAPEM (Sub-Branches)**: 24 subsidiary offices providing regional coverage
- **Geographic Distribution**: 9 regional clusters across 4 provinces
- **Equal Approval Authority**: Both CABANG and CAPEM managers have independent approval rights

Key entities:
- **Units (Branches)**: CABANG/CAPEM branch offices with geographic metadata and business classifications
- **Users**: Role-based users with branch assignments (159 Indonesian users across 53 branches)
- **Tickets**: Full audit trail with branch-based approval workflows
- **Approvals**: Unit-isolated approval chains with equal authority for CABANG/CAPEM
- **SLA Policies**: Business hours calculation with branch-specific configurations
- **Escalation Rules**: Post-approval escalations with geographic considerations
- **Knowledge Articles**: Versioned with regional relevance tagging

### Branch Network Architecture

**CABANG/CAPEM Equal Authority Model**:
```
Branch Manager Authority:
├── CABANG Manager (e.g., UTAMA, JAKARTA, GORONTALO)
│   ├── Approves tickets from CABANG unit only
│   ├── isBusinessReviewer: true
│   └── No authority over CAPEM units
└── CAPEM Manager (e.g., KELAPA GADING, TUMINTING)
    ├── Approves tickets from CAPEM unit only  
    ├── isBusinessReviewer: true
    └── Independent authority (not deferring to CABANG)
```

**Geographic Distribution**:
- **Sulawesi Utara**: 34 branches (Manado Metro, Minahasa, North Coast, Bolaang Mongondow, Sangihe Islands)
- **Gorontalo**: 13 branches (Metropolitan and rural areas)
- **DKI Jakarta**: 4 branches (Business center operations)
- **Jawa Timur**: 2 branches (Regional expansion)

**Business Classifications**:
- **Strategic Tiers**: Tier 1-Strategic (7), Tier 2-Important (5), Tier 3-Standard (5), Tier 4-Coverage (36)
- **Market Sizes**: Large (1), Medium (27), Standard (25)
- **Business Districts**: Financial District, Commercial Hub, Tourism Gateway, Industrial Zone

### Key Development Patterns

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns with controllers, services, and repositories
2. **API-First Design**: All features accessible via RESTful API
3. **Event-Driven**: Use events for approval notifications and workflow transitions
4. **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models for complex approval queries
5. **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns for external service calls
6. **Branch-Based Isolation**: Unit-isolated approval workflows with zero cross-dependencies
7. **Equal Authority Model**: Democratic approval structure (CABANG = CAPEM authority)
8. **Geographic Intelligence**: Regional clustering for analytics and operational insights

### Critical Features Implementation Notes

**Approval Workflow Engine**: 
- **Unit-Based Approval Isolation**: Each CABANG/CAPEM unit has independent approval authority
- **Equal Authority Implementation**: CAPEM managers do not defer to CABANG managers
- **Geographic Fallback**: Department-level technicians can serve all branches
- **Branch-Specific Routing**: Tickets route to managers within the same unit only
- Handle delegation when managers are out of office
- Implement approval via email functionality
- Track approval response times and send reminders

**Branch Management System**:
- **53 Active Branches**: Complete BSG banking network (27 CABANG + 24 CAPEM + 2 legacy)
- **159 Indonesian Users**: Realistic user base with authentic Indonesian naming patterns
- **9 Geographic Clusters**: Regional organization for analytics and reporting
- **4-Tier Strategic Classification**: Business importance and resource allocation
- **Multi-Provincial Coverage**: Operations across Sulawesi Utara, Gorontalo, DKI Jakarta, Jawa Timur

**SLA Engine**: 
- Must exclude approval time from SLA calculations
- SLA timer starts only when ticket status changes from "Pending Approval" to "New"
- Account for business hours, holidays, and pause/resume functionality
- Calculate remaining time in real-time with WebSocket updates

**Escalation System**: 
- Process in background jobs, not synchronously
- Only escalate tickets that have been approved (status != "Pending Approval")
- Support time-based escalations (e.g., "after 2 hours of no response")
- Support condition-based escalations (e.g., "high priority + network category")

**Notification System**:
- High-priority notifications for pending approvals
- Approval reminder emails (daily for pending approvals)
- Real-time updates when approvals are granted/denied
- Approval delegation notifications

**Security**: 
- Implement OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Approval audit trails with digital signatures
- Rate limiting on approval requests
- Input validation and comprehensive audit logging
