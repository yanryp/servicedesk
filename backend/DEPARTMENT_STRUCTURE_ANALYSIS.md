# Department Structure Analysis and Fix

## Problem Identified

The system had **3 departments** instead of the expected **2 departments**:

1. ✅ **Information Technology** (ID: 5) - Correct
2. ✅ **Dukungan dan Layanan** (ID: 6) - Correct  
3. ❌ **Operations** (ID: 7) - **INCORRECT - Should not exist**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Source
The incorrect "Operations" department was created in `/backend/scripts/seed-bsg-complete.ts` on lines 59-66:

```typescript
const operationsDepartment = await prisma.department.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Operations',
    description: 'Banking operations and business processes',
    departmentType: 'business',
    isServiceOwner: false  // ⚠️ This was set to false, indicating it shouldn't handle services
  }
});
```

### Problems Caused
1. **Branch Units Misassignment**: All 15 branch units (CABANG/CAPEM) were assigned to "Operations" department
2. **User Misassignment**: Branch managers and requesters were assigned to "Operations" 
3. **No Service Ownership**: Operations department had `isServiceOwner: false` and 0 service catalogs
4. **Workflow Confusion**: Tickets would route to a department with no services and no service ownership

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Script: `fix-department-structure.ts`

1. **✅ Moved Branch Units**: All 15 units (8 CABANG + 7 CAPEM) moved from Operations → Dukungan dan Layanan
2. **✅ Moved Users**: 3 users (2 managers + 1 requester) moved from Operations → Dukungan dan Layanan  
3. **✅ Deleted Operations Department**: Safely removed after confirming no dependencies
4. **✅ Verified Final State**: Confirmed correct 2-department structure

## Final Correct Structure

## Prevention Measures

### Scripts to Avoid Running
The following script created the incorrect department structure:
- ❌ `seed-bsg-complete.ts` - Contains Operations department creation

### Recommended Scripts  
Use these scripts for proper department structure:
- ✅ `restore-test-credentials.ts` - Creates only IT and Support departments
- ✅ `seed-production-data.ts` - Creates only IT and Support departments
- ✅ `simple-seed.ts` - Works with existing correct departments

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check current department count (should be 2)
node -e "
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
prisma.department.count().then(count => {
  console.log('Total departments:', count);
  prisma.\$disconnect();
});
"

# Generate service mapping report
npx tsx scripts/generate-service-mapping.ts
```

## Summary Statistics

✅ **Final Results**:
- 🏢 **Departments**: 2 (correct)
- 📋 **Service Catalogs**: 9 
- 📂 **Service Items**: 245
- 👥 **Users**: 8
- 🏦 **Branch Units**: 15

🎯 **Service Distribution**:
- **IT Department**: 102 service items (technical focus)
- **Support Department**: 143 service items (banking focus)

The system now has the correct 2-department structure with proper service mapping and branch assignments as specified in the original requirements.
