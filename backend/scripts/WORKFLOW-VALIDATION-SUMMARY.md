- Needed: Email/SMS notifications to managers and technicians

### ‚ùå Comprehensive SLA Performance Dashboards
- Current: Basic dashboard with SLA compliance percentage
- Needed: Detailed SLA performance analytics
- Needed: Technician performance metrics
- Needed: Department-wise SLA reporting

### ‚ùå Dynamic SLA Assignment
- Current: Static policy matching based on service/priority
- Needed: Customer-specific SLA policies
