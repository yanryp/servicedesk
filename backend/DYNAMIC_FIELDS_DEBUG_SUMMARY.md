# Dynamic Fields Debug Summary

## Issue
21 services including "OLIBs - Pendaftaran User Baru" and "ATM-Permasalahan Teknis" were not showing dynamic fields in the customer portal.

## Root Cause
1. The services existed as `ServiceItem` records but had no associated `ServiceFieldDefinition` records
2. The customer portal was looking for BSG templates (which didn't exist) but the backend API correctly falls back to ServiceItem fields
3. The services had no field definitions at all in the database

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Dynamic Fields to Services
Created `ServiceFieldDefinition` records for two main services:

#### OLIBs - Pendaftaran User Baru (6 fields):
- Nama Lengkap (text, required)
- NIP - Nomor Induk Pegawai (text, required) 
- Jabatan (text, required)
- Unit Kerja (text, required)
- Jenis Akses yang Diperlukan (dropdown with 3 options, required)
- Modul yang Diakses (checkbox with 5 options, required)

#### ATM-Permasalahan Teknis (6 fields):
- Lokasi ATM (text, required)
- Terminal ID (text, required)
- Jenis Masalah (dropdown with 6 options, required)
- Deskripsi Detail Masalah (textarea, required)
- Waktu Kejadian (datetime, required)
- Dampak terhadap Layanan (radio with 3 options, required)

### 2. API Response Structure
The backend correctly transforms these fields into the format expected by the customer portal:
```json
{
  "id": "service_16",
  "name": "OLIBs - Pendaftaran User Baru",
  "hasTemplate": true,
  "hasFields": true,
  "fieldCount": 6,
  "fields": [...]
}
```

### 3. Files Created
- `add-dynamic-fields-to-services.js` - Main script to add fields
- `add-missing-fields.js` - Script to add the missing dropdown/checkbox fields
- `check-service-fields.js` - Verification script
- `test-service-api-response.js` - API response simulation

## Result
Both services now have dynamic fields that will appear in the customer portal when users select these services.

## Remaining Work
54 other services still don't have fields defined. If needed, we can:
1. Add generic fields to all services without fields
2. Create specific field templates for each service type
3. Import field definitions from a CSV file if available
