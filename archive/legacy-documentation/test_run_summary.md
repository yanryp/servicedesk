# End-to-End Test Run Summary

This document summarizes the errors found and resolved during the comprehensive end-to-end testing of the ticketing system application.

## 1. Invalid User Credentials

*   **Issue:** The initial Playwright tests failed with "Invalid credentials" errors during the login steps.
*   **Root Cause:** The user emails and passwords hardcoded in `bsg-workflow.spec.js` did not match the test user data in the `backend/scripts/seed-test-users.js` seed script.
*   **Resolution:** The `testUsers` object in `bsg-workflow.spec.js` was updated with the correct email addresses and passwords from the seed data.

## 2. Database Seeding Failures

*   **Issue:** The `npm run db:seed` command failed repeatedly with foreign key constraint violations.
*   **Root Cause:** The seed script attempted to delete tables in the wrong order, violating database integrity. For example, it tried to delete `User` records before the `Ticket` records that depended on them.
*   **Resolution:** The `backend/scripts/seed-test-users.js` script was modified to delete records in the correct order of dependency:
    1.  `Ticket`
    2.  `ServiceCatalog`
    3.  `Category`
    4.  `User`
    5.  `Department`

## 3. Ambiguous Playwright Locator

*   **Issue:** After fixing the credential and seeding issues, the tests failed with a `strict mode violation` because the locator `text=Logout` resolved to multiple elements on the page.
*   **Root Cause:** The UI contained more than one element with the text "Logout", making the test script's locator ambiguous.
*   **Resolution:** The locator was updated from `page.locator('text=Logout')` to `page.locator('text=Logout').first()` to ensure Playwright consistently selected the first visible logout button.

With these fixes, the end-to-end test suite now runs successfully, validating the core application workflow.
